# Zombies

## Getting Started
Before you'll be able to play Zombies, you must first obtain the following 3rd
party libraries:

* [Allegro4.4](https://www.allegro.cc/files/?v=4.4)
* libudev (install via `apt-get install libudev-dev`)

Note that to simplify the building of Allegro, you'll need cmake (>= v2.2)

**NOTE:** As of 09-14-2017, Zombies has only been tested on Ubuntu 14.04
